**Pomidoro - This is a simple timer that follows the Pomodoro rule.**

---

Future updates will add the ability to choose Pomodoro modes: 25/5(+30), 30/5(+30), 60/10(+60), 180/30(+60), as well as any other user-provided modes.

The Pomodoro timer is a great tool for focusing and concentrating. Its simplicity and uncluttered design are always convenient.
